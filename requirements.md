# mcm-cois-2350-week2

Write a simple Java program by modifying the starter code in the file named Greeting.java to do the following:

Develop a "Student Introduction Tool" that displays the following details, each on a separate line (using separate output statements):

```
Your name
Your student ID 
The list of courses you are taking this semester
```

A motivational quote or message that inspires you (choose your own!)

The program should display everything in a neat and clear format similar to the sample output file provided in the activity repository.

⚡ Hint: You don’t need loops or arrays yet. Just use multiple System.out.println statements for each line of text. It is expected that all your code should go inside the main method for the most part to get it functional. 

Example Output (your details will be different!):

```
Hello, my name is WarHawks.  
My student ID is: 123456  
This semester, I am registered for the following courses:  
- COIS-2350: Introduction to Programming  
- COIS-2450: Computer Networks  
- COIS-3250: Database Systems  

"Learning never exhausts the mind." – Leonardo da Vinci  
```
It is very important to make sure you match the output and review the First.java program that we did in class for getting proper directions. 

Add your detailed comments through general header comments and comments inside your program. 

Commands for running the program:

javac Greeting.java
